Following a political crisis, South Korea dramatically altered its development strategy with a sector-specific industrial policy: the heavy and chemical industry (HCI) drive, 1973–1979. Based on newly assembled data, I use the abrupt introduction and withdrawal of industrial policies to study the impacts of industrial policy during and after the intervention period. (1) I reveal that HCI promoted the expansion and dynamic comparative advantage of directly targeted industries. (2) Using variation in exposure to policies through the input–output network, I demonstrate that HCI indirectly benefited downstream users of targeted intermediates. (3) I determine that the direct and indirect benefits of HCI persisted even after the end of HCI, following the 1979 assassination of the president. These benefits include the eventual development of directly targeted exporters and their downstream counterparts. Together, my findings suggest that this temporary drive shifted Korean manufacturing into more advanced markets, creating durable industrial change. These findings clarify lessons drawn from South Korea and the East Asian growth miracle.},

            After decades of supporting free trade, in 2018 the United States raised import tariffs and major trade partners retaliated. We analyze the short-run impact of this return to protectionism on the U.S. economy. Import and retaliatory tariffs caused large declines in imports and exports. Prices of imports targeted by tariffs did not fall, implying complete pass-through of tariffs to duty-inclusive prices. The resulting losses to U.S. consumers and firms that buy imports was \$51 billion, or 0.27\% of GDP. We embed the estimated trade elasticities in a general-equilibrium model of the U.S. economy. After accounting for tariff revenue and gains to domestic producers, the aggregate real income loss was \$7.2 billion, or 0.04\% of GDP. Import tariffs favored sectors concentrated in politically competitive counties, and the model implies that tradeable-sector workers in heavily Republican counties were the most negatively affected due to the retaliatory tariffs.

Despite this, the European Union followed the United States’ example in imposing anti-dumping tariffs on solar panel imports from China in 2012, arguing that Chinese panels were unfairly subsidised and harmed its domestic industry. This paper examines the effects of Chinese import competition on firm-level innovation in solar photovoltaic technology by European firms using a sample of 4,632 fi rms in 14 EU countries over the period 19992018. I show that firms which were exposed to higher import competition innovated more. Further, I find that during the years following the trade war, firms with a higher existing stock of innovation became less innovative. The results imply that competition from China constituted a positive push for more innovation among European solar innovators, calling into question the rationale behind the trade war.},

We build a price competition duopoly model with differentiated products and intra-industry trade in photovoltaic (PV) equipment. We show that an optimal antidumping duty always increases with the feed-in tariff (FIT) program set in the home country. An appropriate antidumping duty—nullifying the dumping margin—decreases with the FIT program. We show that optimal FIT increases with the AD duty. Therefore, trade and renewable energy optimal policies may complement one another. Lastly, we introduce R\&D activities in the PV sector, and international spillovers. We show that R\&D makes the optimal FIT lower and increases the dumping margin. These effects are reinforced by technological spillovers.},

We correct for endogeneity using the removal of product-speciﬁc quotas following China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001. Chinese import competition led to increased technical change within ﬁrms and reallocated employment between ﬁrms towards more technologically advanced ﬁrms. These within and between effects were about equal in magnitude, and account for 14\% of European technology upgrading over 2000–7 (and even more when we allow for offshoring to China). Rising Chinese import competition also led to falls in employment and the share of unskilled workers. In contrast to low-wage nations like China, developed countries had no signiﬁcant effect on innovation.},

While acknowledging the significance of concentrated foreign input sourcing as a source of vulnerability, a comprehensive assessment of vulnerabilities should also consider the potential for substituting away from disrupted input sources, both domestically and abroad. This may necessitate devising novel statistical measures at the European level. We present a novel methodology that identifies trade dependencies by integrating these substitution sources. Our review encompasses normative arguments justifying public interventions to improve the resilience of value chains. We intersect our identified dependencies with a measure of geopolitical risk, their upstreamness in the value chain, and also focus on critical products and strategic green technologies. The specific targeting of these policies varies depending on the nature of risks they aim to mitigate. Finally, we discuss the range of policy tools available for crafting a resilience policy.},

Should governments promote resilience by subsidizing backup sources of input supply? Should they encourage firms to source from closer and presumably safer domestic suppliers? We address these questions in a very simple model of production with a single critical input and with exogenous risks of relationship-specific and country-wide supply disturbances. We follow Matsuyama and Ushchev (2020) in positing a class of preferences that are homothetic with a single aggregator and that obey Marshall's Second Law of Demand. The familiar case of CES preferences is a member of the class, but it imposes restrictions that are important for policy conclusions.We find that, in the CES case, a subsidy for diversification achieves the constrained social optimum and dominates a policy that promotes reshoring or offshoring. When the demand elasticity rises with price, two policy instruments generally are needed to achieve efficient supply chains, private investments in resilience may be socially excessive, and policy that alter incentives to invest at home versus abroad may achieve greater welfare than ones that encourage or discourage diversification.},

But the trade defence case was also criticized for running against European climate policy goals. To which extent does this case illustrate a normative conflict between trade and the environment? The article replaces the dispute in the context of the trade defence procedures, according to which the EU had to decide, first, whether China’s subsidization of its PV industry was illegal, and second, whether Europe’s climate policies warranted against imposing trade defence duties. It finds that, in this case, the familiar competition between divergent European industrial interests was made worse by an important normative cleavage amongst European decision-makers, regarding the appropriate way to achieve global climate change policy goals. Simply applying the law did not settle the dispute. Instead, it plastered a political compromise emerged from a shift in the political narrative of the dispute, from emphasizing competition to emphasizing interdependence, pushing the Commission into a political compromise with China.},

This study employs real options method to assess the optimal levels of feed-in tariffs in 30 provinces of China. The uncertainties in CO2 price and investment cost are considered. A method that integrates the backward dynamic programming algorithm and Least-Squares Monte Carlo method is used to solve the model. The results demonstrate that the feed-in tariffs of 30 provinces range from 0.68 RMB/kWh to 1.71 RMB/kWh, and the average level is 1.01 RMB/kWh. On this basis, we find that the levels of sub-regional feed-in tariff announced in 2013 are no longer appropriate and should be adjusted as soon as possible. We have also identified the implications of technological progress and carbon emission trading schemes, as well as the importance of strengthening electricity transmission. It has been suggested that the Chinese government takes diverse measures, including increasing research and development investment, establishing and improving a nationwide carbon emission trading scheme and accelerating the construction of electricity-transmission infrastructure, to reduce the required feed-in tariff and promote the development of solar photovoltaic power generation.},

Although domestically manufactured modules may cost more than Chinese or ASEAN imports, the majority of upfront expenditures come from balance-of-system costs. Thus, the additional expense of domestic modules will have only a limited impact on the cost of investment and, consequently, on generation costs. » (International Energy Agency, 2022, p. 93)(International Energy Agency, 2022, p. 104)« n the early 2000s, the Chinese government selected solar PV as a key industry to enrich its economy and exports. In its 10th Five-Year Plan for 2001-2005, China’s State Economic and Trade Commission released a vision for expanding the industrialisation of renewable energy technologies, including by scaling up solar PV Special Report on Solar PV Global Supply Chains Chapter 4 - Policy strategies for solar PV manufacturing and recycling 107 cell and module manufacturing. This vision and strategy thus mark the introduction of central and provincial-level incentives for solar PV manufacturing. » (International Energy Agency, 2022, p. 106)« 11th Five-Year Plan, China identified PV manufacturing hindrances such as its lack of polysilicon capacity (at that time, China imported 95\% of the polysilicon it used for PV manufacturing) and dependence on imported manufacturing equipment. The government therefore decided to promote domestic polysilicon and equipment manufacturing through grants » (International Energy Agency, 2022, p. 107)« China’s incentives initially targeted direct supply rather than domestic demand creation. Grants, lowcost loans from state banks and funds from the Science and Technology Ministry thus led to the establishment of several pioneering domestic manufacturers. » (International Energy Agency, 2022, p. 107)« In the absence of domestic demand, Chinese manufacturers had to improve their competitiveness. They therefore focused on economies of scale and integration of supply chain segments to reduce costs, increase exports and expand their global market share. » (International Energy Agency, 2022, p. 107)« Grants, low-cost financing and preferential energy prices have been in place since 2005, and following the global financial crisis in 2008, the government introduced economic recovery packages for provinces through lowcost financing from the China Development Bank (CDB). » (International Energy Agency, 2022, p. 107)« Japan, Korea and Germany became the largest manufacturers of polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules globally in the late 1990s and early 2000s owing to a combination of direct demand and indirect supply policies. » (International Energy Agency, 2022, p. 108)« Germany, Korea and Japan also have distinct industrial policies in place: national or federal grants, tax incentives, and loan programmes for the machinery and hightechnology manufacturing sectors. In Japan and Korea, industrial strategy has historically targeted large, vertically integrated conglomerate companies active in multiple sectors, while in Germany small and medium-sized companies have been the main recipients of government support. In all three countries, regional and industrial development funds were also used to support solar PV component and equipment manufacturers. » (International Energy Agency, 2022, p. 109)« In Germany, the Joint Task Cash Grants and Investment Allowance programmes supported solar PV companies active in polysilicon, wafer, cell and module manufacturing through grants for CAPEX and operating costs, with the requirement that subsidised equipment remain in the investment location for at least five years. Similarly, Japan and Korea provide comparable industrial incentives for the manufacturing sector. All three countries have developed companies that manufacture equipment for polysilicon, wafer, cell and module production, and advanced automation industries in these countries have also contributed to the solar PV manufacturing equipment industry. Germany, Korea and Japan were also at the forefront in providing subsidies for demand creation in the early 2000s through FITs or long-term remuneration to create local demand. Rising domestic demand, supportive industrial policies and export opportunities made it financially attractive for many German SMEs and large Japanese and Korean companies to launch businesses in multiple segments of solar PV manufacturing, making them global leaders until 2012/13. In Germany, domestic demand began to decline in 2011 following a downward revision of the FIT, at the same time as China was investing heavily in solar PV manufacturing capabilities targeting exports. The oversupply of solar PV modules and aggressive pricing of Chinese manufacturers pushed prices down significantly and reduced the profitability of German manufacturers who had higher labour and energy costs than their Chinese counterparts. » (International Energy Agency, 2022, p. 109)(International Energy Agency, 2022, p. 110)(International Energy Agency, 2022, p. 112)(International Energy Agency, 2022, p. 114)

« The US-China trade war created net export opportunities rather than simply shifting trade across destinations. Many “bystander” countries grew their exports of taxed products into the rest of the world (excluding the United States and China). » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 295)« While the US-China trade war can be seen as a turning point in the globalization era, it has also presented “bystander” countries with the opportunity to grow exports to the world’s biggest economies and, potentially, among themselves. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 295)« Did other countries take over the US and Chinese markets? Did they reallocate exports away from the rest of the world? » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 295)« The empirical analysis is guided by a Ricardian-Armington trade model allowing substitution elasticities to be country-pair specific and above or below one, and for country- and sector-specific supply elasticities that may be downward sloping. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 296)« Our first proposition derives, from a first-order approximation around an arbitrary equilibrium, a formula for the reduced-form elasticity of a bystander’s product-level exports (to the United States, China, and the rest of the world) to US and Chinese tariffs. This elasticity captures the effects of demand shifts due to tariff changes, conditioning on indirect demand and supply shifters through general equilibrium adjustments. Our second proposition shows that, properly controlling for these indirect effects, the estimated tariff elasticities of exports jointly identify (i) whether a country’s exports substitute or complement the United States or China and (ii) whether it operates along downward- or upward-sloping supply curves. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 296)« We implement the empirical analysis on global bilateral HS6-level trade data. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 296)« The first takeaway is that, on average, bystanders increased their exports to the United States, barely changed their exports to China, and increased their exports to the rest of the world in products with higher US-Chinese tariffs. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 296)« Therefore, the trade war created net trade opportunities rather than simply shifting trade across destinations. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 296)« This initial approach assumes common tariff elasticities across countries, but these elasticities may vary by exporter, importer, sector, and size of the trade flow, as implied by the model. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 296)« This flexible specification reveals a second takeaway: there is substantial cross-country heterogeneity in export growth in targeted products compared to nontargeted products. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 296)« The average export growth in taxed products across countries is 6.4 percent with a standard deviation across countries of 6.2 percent (compared to a standard deviation of just 1.4 percent implied by a specification with homogeneous tariff elasticities). » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 296)« These cross-country differences in export growth in targeted products result from (i) tariff elasticities that differ by country and (ii) tariff elasticities that differ by sector and size of the trade flow, combined with prewar specialization patterns across products. Our third key takeaway is that the country-specific component explains the bulk—75.8 percent—of the cross-country variation in export growth in targeted products. The combination of prewar specialization and size-dependent or sector-specific tariff elasticities explain the remaining variation. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 297)« Having isolated the country-specific component as the key driver of heterogeneous export growth, we exploit our theoretical proposition to identify supply and demand channels. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 297)« Importantly, the interaction of demand and supply heterogeneity in the elasticities matters: due to different patterns of demand substitution, countries operating along downward-sloping supplies can be found among those with the strongest and the weakest export growth. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 297)« Our first result—that the average country increases global exports in products taxed by the United States or China—suggests an interdependency across export destinations. We rationalize this finding through downward-sloping supply curves at the product level. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 297)« The result is also consistent with reallocations of supply chains under particular input-output structures.3 Flaaen, Hortaçsu, and Tintelnot (2020) show that, for washing machines, product-specific capital migrates from China to other countries serving as export platforms to the United States in order to avoid the tariffs. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 297)« Our subsequent results, which reveal substantial cross-country heterogeneity in export growth consistent with country-specific demand and supply elasticities, are surprising given that trade or scale elasticities are typically assumed to vary across sectors rather than across countries. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 297)« These empirical results are also broadly consistent with, and could be explained by, frameworks that feature flexible patterns of substitution across imports, such as Adao, Costinot, and Donaldson (2017) and Lind and Ramondo (2023). » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 298)« When σi′i j {\textgreater} 0 (σi′i j {\textless} 0), varieties i and i′ ≠ i are substitutes (complements) within sector j, in the sense that an increase in the price of goods from i leads to increase (reduction) in the » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 298)« expenditure share (and quantity) purchased in goods from i′.6 We impose a common substitution elasticity within the sector: σii′ j = σRW j for i′ ≠ i and i, i′ ≠ US, CH. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 299)(Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 300)(Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 301)« We use UN Comtrade (2022) data recording bilateral exports in 5,203 HS6 products. We aggregate into 24-month intervals (2014/2015; 2016/2017; 2018/2019) and refer to each 24-month period by its ending year. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 302)« We consider four sets of tariff changes as part of the US-China trade war: (i) imposed by the United States on China (the “US tariffs”), denoted as TCH,ω US , where ω denotes an HS6 product code; (ii) imposed by China on the United States, TUS,ω CH (the “Chinese tariffs”); (iii) imposed by the United States on each country i other than China, Ti,UωS (e.g., steel tariffs on Mexico); and (iv) most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffs imposed by China on all countries but the United States, Ti,CωH. Bown, Jung, and Zhang (2019) argue that China’s MFN tariff cuts were likely influenced by the trade war with the United States, so we include them in our analysis. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 302)« We use census data (US Census Bureau 2020) to compute dollar-weighted averages of tariffs at the HS6 level and scale tariff changes in proportion to their duration within each 24-month interval. This scaling generates variation in tariff changes across products due to both the timing and magnitude of rate changes. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 302)(Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 303)« These results suggest that the trade war created net trade opportunities on average rather than merely prompting reallocations: joint exports to the United States and China in tariff-exposed products increased and so did exports to the rest of the world. However, this average response masks large heterogeneity across countries. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 304)« First, we set β5ni and β6ni in equation (5) to zero. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 304)« (10) Δ ln Xinω = β1niω Δ lnTCH,ω US + β2niω Δ ln TUS,ω CH + β3niω Δ ln Ti,UωS + β4niω Δ ln Ti,CωH + αij(ω) n + Ωn SIZEiω + πnΔ ln Xiω,t−1 n + εinω » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 305)« The identifying assumption underlying this empirical strategy is that, within origin-destination-sector, potential export growth across products would have been the same in the absence of the trade war tariffs. We assess the plausibility of this parallel trends assumption by testing for differential trends in export growth in the years prior to the trade war. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 305)« The analysis reveals two key takeaways: (i) substantial cross-country heterogeneity in export growth in targeted products compared to nontargeted products and (ii) a central role for the country-specific component of the tariff elasticities, rather than any other component, in explaining this heterogeneity. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 306)« Online Appendix Table A.1 provides a taxonomy to understand the underlying demand and supply forces driving countries’ exports from the trade war. We construct an empirical analog to the table by aggregating the variety-level tariff elasticities to the country level: (12) βˆ zni = ω ∑ λnXiω βˆ zniω. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 307)(Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 307)« The figure shows that there is considerable variation across countries in the underlying supply and demand forces that drive export responses in Figure 2. To highlight a few examples, consider first the set of countries that lie in the same quadrant in both panels (highlighted in blue). Ukraine and Colombia lie in the southwest quadrants, indicating that they export varieties that complement Chinese and American varieties and that their exports operate along downward-sloping supply curves. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 308)(Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 308)(Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 309)« While product-level global trade data can uncover broad reallocation patterns, firm-level data can unpack the factors driving the country-specific elasticitieswhether they consist of increasing returns to scale, trade war–induced investments in new plants, or participation in trade agreements. Our reduced-form tariff elasticities could also be used to target moments and identify parameters in estimated general equilibrium models. » (Fajgelbaum et al., 2024, p. 310)

Despite this, the European Union followed the United States’ example in imposing anti-dumping tariffs on solar panel imports from China in 2013, arguing that Chinese panels were unfairly subsidised and harmed its domestic industry. This paper examines the effects of Chinese import competition on firm-level innovation in solar photovoltaic technology by European firms using a sample of 10,137 firms in 15 EU countries over the period 1999–2020. I show that firms which were exposed to higher import competition innovated more if they had a relatively small existing stock of innovation, but less if their historical knowledge stock fell within the top 10th percentile of firms in the sample. This suggests that newer firms were more able to respond to increased competition by innovating, while firms with a large historical stock of innovation may have been locked into old technological paradigms. As firms with a smaller knowledge stock tended to innovate more overall, trade with China appears to have been beneficial in encouraging innovation among the most innovative firms. However, I also find evidence that import competition increased the probability of exit among firms in the sample.},

Two of the most important trade agreements, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the European Union (EU), recently enacted major changes to those rules. The 2020 USMCA agreement replacing NAFTA made those rules much stricter. Meanwhile, following its exit from the EU customs union, Britain and the remaining EU27 had to draw up new rules of origin for the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). This chapter quantifies the main trade-offs involved in setting the strictness of RoOs in the context of the automobile industry. A more stringent agreement can raise or lower regional parts production, but it inevitably raises prices. Fitting our model to data on the use of NAFTA-origin parts in cars assembled within the region, we calibrate the key parameters that govern the responses to stricter RoOs. We then apply the calibrated model to evaluate the switch from NAFTA to the USMCA as well as other counterfactuals of interest.},

With fixed assembly locations, the higher RoO reduces employment in all three countries for cars, where tariffs are low. For trucks, the 25\% US tariff induces more compliance in Canada and Mexico, increasing employment in those countries. With the option to relocate assembly, higher RoOs redistribute employment to the US, but Canada and Mexico lose more, leading to a half percent decline in North American employment for both cars and trucks.},

	abstract = {We examine the ways in which political realities shape industrial policy through the lens of modern political economy. We consider two broad "governance constraints": (1) the political forces that shape how industrial policy is chosen and (2) the ways in which state capacity affects implementation. The framework of modern political economy suggests that government failure is not a necessary feature of industrial policy; rather, it is more likely to fail when countries pursue industrial policies beyond their governance capacity constraints. As such, our political economy of industrial policy is not fatalist. Instead, it enables policymakers to constructively confront challenges.},

The 2012 and 2016 antidumping duties against South Korea and China were accompanied by downward or minor price movements along with production relocation to other export platform countries. With the 2018 tariffs, on nearly all source countries, the price of washers increased nearly 12 percent. Interestingly, the price of dryers—not subject to tariffs—increased by an equivalent amount. Factoring in dryer prices and price increases by domestic brands, the 2018 tariffs on washers imply a tariff elasticity of consumer prices of above one. (JEL F13, F14, F23, L68, 019, P33)},

An analysis using direct and indirect value-added linkages along the supply chain shows that China plays an important, but by no means dominant role for Germany as a supplier or destination market. However, in a survey conducted by the ifo Institute, 46\% of German firms in the manufacturing sector state that they currently depend on important intermediate inputs from China. Of those, almost half of the firms are planning to reduce imports from China in the future. The most frequently mentioned reasons for reducing imports from China are the desire to decrease dependencies and increase diversification, increased freight costs and disruptions in transportation, as well as political uncertainty. An analysis at the product level shows that the German economy depends on several critical industrial goods and raw materials from China.},

To begin, we construct a product-level index of relationship stickiness using ﬁrm-to-ﬁrm relationship duration data. We then demonstrate how relationship stickiness shapes trade dynamics in response to uncertainty shocks. We ﬁnd that episodes of uncertainty lead to a decline in the overall establishment of new business relationships, with the impact varying depending on the level of stickiness. In markets characterized by high stickiness, uncertainty shocks primarily impede investments in new ﬁrm-to-ﬁrm relationships. In contrast, for non-sticky products, the adjustment to uncertainty shocks mainly manifests as the disruption of existing relationships.},

	abstract = {Many treatments, such as prices, taxes, or temperatures, are continuous in nature. Empirical researchers usually rely on two-way fixed effect regressions to estimate treatment effects in such cases. However, such estimators are not robust to heterogeneous treatment effects in general and rely on the linearity of treatment effects. We develop a difference-in-difference strategy for continuous treatments without imposing such restrictions when there are no stayers: treatment of all units changes between consecutive periods. We extend the nonparametric results of de Chaisemartin et al. (2023) to this setup and present a parametric approach that overcomes some limitations of the nonparametric approach.},

Industries more exposed to the change experience greater employment loss, increased imports from China, and higher entry by US importers and foreign-owned Chinese exporters. At the plant level, shifts toward less labor-intensive production and exposure to the policy via input-output linkages also contribute to the decline in employment. Results are robust to other potential explanations of employment loss, and there is no similar reaction in the European Union, where policy did not change.},
