# EU-US-China: trade dispute, a resiliency approach. The solar panel case

## Introduction

This repository contains all the necessary files to ensure the replication of my master thesis "EU-US-China: trade dispute, a resiliency approach. The solar panel case". 

This project questions the effiency of targeted tariffs to reduce dependency to Chinese import for solar panel, being through national production or diversification of imports. To answer this question we analyze the evolution of trade flow following the implementation of tariffs on Chinese SP in 2012 and 2013, and the global tradereallocation that followed. The objective is to assess if these reallocations were due to a Chinese manouveur to circumvent tariffs or the emergence of competitors to the Chinese production. For that we can use the dual case of the U.S. and the E.U which imposed about the same time targeted tariffs, with the difference that in 2014 the U.S. noticed what they deemed to be circounventing practices from the Chinese SP producers and then rose tariffs to a new set of East-Asian countries, when the E.U. did not. All in all, this conflict around a crucial good for the future of decarbonized energy offer us an element of answer of the resiliency policy that can be adopted by major economies in a world of rising commercial, environmental, and political tensions.
